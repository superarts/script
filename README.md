# Script Collection

This is my script collection. I've been using a file located at ~/Dropbox/etc to store my credentials, you may need to remove the include or create an empty one to get some scripts running.

## android-manifest.php

Change package name, add permission, launch the app on device, etc.

## html-parser.php

Parse HTML contents into PHP array

## source-split.php

Split source files into classes. Still under development.
